# Aero-Assist

This project focuses on implementing path planning and obstacle avoidance system to help people with limited mobility. It involves data annotation, object detection using YOLO, and Dijkstra's path planning algorithm implementation.

## Features

- **Data Annotation**: Annotation of data for use in training object detection models using Roboflow.
- **Object Detection**: Implementation of object detection using the YOLO algorithm is done in Google Colab.
- **Path Planning**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for optimal path planning.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Integration of object detection with path planning for real-time obstacle avoidance in python script.

## Data

- Data files can be found in this location [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/custom-object-detection-vvwt6/accessibility-object-detection/).

## Distribution of Data Classes

## Results after training Yolo


## Simulated Enviroment

- Visualizations of the results, including plots and graphs, can be found in the `results/` directory.

## Environment conversion to graph

## Video Demo of execution

## Acknowledgments

- We would like to thank the developers of YOLO for providing an excellent object detection algorithm.
- Thanks to the open-source community for their contributions and resources.
